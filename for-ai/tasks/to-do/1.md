Please listen to the test prompt that I recorded in the testing folder. 

I recorded this at my desk (usually I record on my phone). So the audio codec and wrapper might be different, but the content is fairly "on style" and I want to record more prompts in this environment. 

Part of the concept/idea is that the prompt audio will be edited into the audio file that accompanies the post. Down the line, I think this will need to be either manually done or using (almost mature already!) AI audio to audio editing in which the AI tool cuts out the fillter and creates a snappier version suitable for the intended use. But that can wait. 

What would be helpful would be a script that assumes an imperfect audio file like this and applies: normalisation, compression/EQ (my voice doesn't change that often!), and (the most important) silence truncation. The latter is the most important so that if I pause for thought that can get cut out. This would actually serve a secondary purpose of making the next agent step more efficient. 

could you sample some of that file and then write a script?
