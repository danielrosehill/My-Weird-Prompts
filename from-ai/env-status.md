# Environment Variables Status

**Last updated**: 2025-10-24

## ‚úÖ Configured

These API keys are already set in your `.env` file:

- ‚úÖ **ANTHROPIC_API_KEY** - Claude Sonnet 4.5
- ‚úÖ **GEMINI_API_KEY** - Gemini 2.5 Pro (updated variable name)
- ‚úÖ **OPENAI_API_KEY** - OpenAI TTS
- ‚úÖ **VOICENOTES_WEBHOOK_SECRET** - Pre-generated secure secret

## üîß Still Need to Add

Fill in these values in your `.env` file:

### Cloudinary (Required for media hosting)

```env
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=
```

**Get from**: https://cloudinary.com/
- Sign up for free tier (25GB storage, 25GB bandwidth/month)
- Go to Dashboard
- Copy: Cloud Name, API Key, API Secret

### Image Generation (Optional - can skip initially)

```env
STABILITY_API_KEY=
```

**Or use Replicate**:
```env
REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=
```

**Note**: If neither is set, blog posts will use placeholder images

## What You Can Do Now

### With Current Keys (Anthropic + Gemini + OpenAI)

‚úÖ Test Phase 1 (transcription) - works!
‚úÖ Test Phase 2 (response generation) - works!
‚úÖ Test Phase 3 (audio assembly) - works!
‚ùå Phase 3 will fail at upload (needs Cloudinary)
‚ùå Phase 4 will use placeholder images (no image gen API)

### After Adding Cloudinary

‚úÖ Full pipeline will work end-to-end
‚úÖ Audio files will be hosted properly
‚úÖ Images will be hosted properly
‚úÖ Blog posts will have proper media URLs

---

## Testing Commands

### Test without Cloudinary (local testing only)

You can test the first 2-3 phases locally, they'll just fail at the upload step:

```bash
cd code/backend
npm run dev

# In another terminal, test webhook:
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/webhook/voicenotes \
  -F "audio=@../../testing/voice-prompt/rtsp-or-rtc.mp3"

# Watch the logs - Phase 1 & 2 should complete successfully
```

### Test with Cloudinary (full pipeline)

Once you add Cloudinary credentials:

```bash
# Same as above, but all 5 phases will complete
# Blog post will be created with hosted audio and images
```
