## Where to Store Them

### Local Development (RIGHT NOW)
â†’ Add to `/home/daniel/repos/github/My-Weird-Prompts/.env`

### Production Deployment (LATER)
â†’ Add to Vercel project environment variables via web UI or CLI

### GitHub Secrets (NOT NEEDED)
â†’ We're not using GitHub Actions, so skip this

## What I'll Do While You Gather Keys

While you're fishing out API keys, I can:
1. Set up the basic Astro frontend structure
2. Create the webhook receiver scaffolding
3. Build the agent pipeline structure (with placeholder API keys)
4. Create the blog post templates
5. Set up the development environment

Then once you have keys, we can test the full pipeline end-to-end.

**Sound good?** Let me know when you want me to proceed with setup, or if you want to add keys to `.env` first!
